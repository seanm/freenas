# SIGTERM will only happen if systemd kills process that timed out booting (it is the only case in which we don't
# want to restart middleware infinitely as it will cause boot process to hang).
# If user accidentally (or intentionally) kills middleware with SIGTERM, we'll see successful exit because we catch
# SIGTERM and terminate event loop, then exit with successful status.
RestartPreventExitStatus=SIGTERM
# We don't want systemd to kill the middlewared process automatically on service stop, instead we rely on middlewared
# to properly ensure that it shuts down cleanly on stop when SIGTERM is sent.
